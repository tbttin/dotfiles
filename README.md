This is a bare repository of my $HOME. Yeah, I choose git bare method to store dotfiles because it's simple.
This repo contains some personal configuration files (default on Arch Linux) for:
  - Vim
  - Suckless programs: dwm, st, slstatus, ...
  - Makepkg and some suckless's PKGBUILDs.
  - Bash
  - Zathura
  - Some X related config files.
  - Git
  - ...

[This durdn's tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) brought me here D)

Have fun!
