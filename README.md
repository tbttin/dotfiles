This is just a bare reppository of my $HOME. It indludes some configuration files (default on Bash and Arch Linux):
  - Vim
  - Suckless programs: dwm, st, slstatus.
  - Makepkg and suckless program's PKGBUILD.
  - Bash
  - Zathura
  - Some X related config files.
  - Git
  - ...

We have many way to store config files, this durdn's tutorial [How to store dotfiles?](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) is a good introduction to using git to manage dotfiles and QUICKLY bring them back with a single-line of command.

Have fun!
