This is a bare reppository of my $HOME. It indludes configuration files (default on Bash and Arch Linux) for:
  - Vim
  - Suckless programs: dwm, st, slstatus
  - Makepkg
  - Bash
  - Zathura
  - Some X related config files.
  - Git
  - ...

Ofcourse, we have many way to store config files but this durdn's tutorial [How to store dotfiles?](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) is a good introduction about how to use git to manage dotfiles and QUICKLY bring it back with a single-line of command. Have fun!
