# About

This is a bare repository of my `$HOME`. Why git bare? Because it's simple.

This repository contains configuration files (default on Arch Linux) for:

  - Vim

  - Suckless programs: dwm, st, slstatus, ...

  - Makepkg and some suckless's PKGBUILDs.

  - Bash: profile, rc, aliases.

  - Zathura.

  - Some X related config files.

  - Git.

  - ...
